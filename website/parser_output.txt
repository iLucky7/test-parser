h1. Output

h2. Guarantees

The output of the different parsers must vary to a certain degree.  Different testing systems produce varying levels of detail.  Some parsers may return more than the information displayed on this page, though as of version 0.8.0, none do.

This page merely lists things you can be sure about.  This is essentially a retelling of what test-parser's own automated tests ensure. <sup><a href='#note1' id='back1'>1</a></sup>

Only the first property, <code>:failure_count</code> can be guaranteed.  If a parser can't determine the other properties, it may not provide them.  

Partially implemented parsers also might only return some of these properties, but all parsers give a valid result for <code>:failure_count</code>.

h2. :failure_count

The most important property is <code>:failure_count</code>, which gives the number of tests that failed.  All parsers must yield this property.  

The count includes both tests that failed and tests that encountered errors.  

If this property is missing, it's a good indication that there was a major problem.  Ensure that the correct parser is receiving the correct output.

h2. :success_count and :test_count

Two ancillary properties are <code>:success_count</code> and <code>:test_count</code>.  They represent the number of successful tests, and the total number of tests run respectively.  

If both of these properties are present, then <code>:success_count</code> + <code>:failure_count</code> must equal <code>:test_count</code>.

h2. :failures

The last property, <code>:failures</code> is an array of dictionaries<sup><a href='#note2' id='back2'>2</a></sup> containing detailed information about the failed tests.  

If present and nonempty, the length of <code>:failures</code> must equal <code>:failure_count</code>.  

The following are details that may be found in an element of <code>:failures</code>:

<table class='failure_details'>
<tr><td><code>:test</code></td><td>the name of the test that failed</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:file</code></td><td>the filename where the test failed or the error was encountered</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:line</code></td><td>the line number where the test failed/error was encountered</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:method</code></td><td>the method/function/subroutine in which the failure occurred</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:message</code></td><td>a message giving more information about the failure</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:error_type</code></td><td>the class/type of the error encountered</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>:line</code></td><td>the line number where the test failed/error was encountered</td></tr>
</table>
